# 🛒 E-commerce Customer Churn Prediction

🎯 **Goal:**  
Predict whether a customer is likely to churn (leave the platform) based on behavioral and demographic data using Machine Learning models.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

This project uses a real-world e-commerce dataset to identify patterns in customer behavior and predict churn using:

- ✅ Logistic Regression
- 🌲 Decision Tree Classifier

The web app is built with **Streamlit** for interactive visualization and usage.
